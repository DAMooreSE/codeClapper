This software has 2 main functions:
 * Record and save audio and video from the computer running the software with the ability to rerecord and insert clips of audio or video while continuing the recording.
 * Host a User Interface on a local network that allows users access to fully control the recording services on the host machine.

This project uses a variety of software and technology for development including:
 * JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.JS, Aperture.JS, Google Firebase, NPM, Git, Visual Studio Code, and more.
