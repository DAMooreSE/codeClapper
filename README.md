This software has 2 main Components:
 * The first component is a recording service that’s deployable on a computer running MacOS that’s accessible on the local network. The recorder will be able to use any connected audio or video device to record from. The recorder will have the functionality to record video and audio separately and will allow a recording that’s in progress to be restarted, saved, or canceled. It will record the video first and then allow the recording of one or more audio files that will be combined with the video when exported. When a video is exported, the recording service will also output a single video file containing everything that was recorded from the start of the video recording.
 * A web-based user interface that contains the web pages that will allow users to login, start a new recording session, record video and/or audio, and export saved recordings. The User Interface can be accessed through a web browser by any device connected to the same network that the recording service is deployed to.

This project uses a variety of software and technology for development including:
 * JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, React.JS, and Google Firebase for front-end development
 * JavaScript, Aperture.JS, Google Firebase, NPM, and Yarn for the back-end
 * Development also utilized Git, Visual Studio Code, and more.
